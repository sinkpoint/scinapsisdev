    <h2>Money Down the Drain</h2>
        <p>
            Lack of objectivity and conveniently accessible data on antibody functionalities
            lead to annual loss of 800 million dollars in precious research funding.

    <h2>Evidence-Of-Use</h2>

    <p><strong>Peer-reviewed publications are the new catalog for laboratory consumables.</strong>
    Researchers often look for evidence-of-use in literature before buying a new antibody or reagent.
